HasberryPi
==========

Haskell bindings for the wiringPi C library

The hsc2hs command must be run on the .hsc file to generate the actual bindings. The hsc2hs command will generate the HasberryPi.hs file. If you have the Haskell Platform installed, then you will have the hsc2hs command available at the prompt. The HasberryPi.hs file is available in the repository for the purpose of convenience. But it is recommended that you run the hsc2hs tool on the .hsc file to generate the bindings.
